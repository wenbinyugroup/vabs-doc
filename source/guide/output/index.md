# Outputs

VABS homogenization analysis outputs the sectional properties stored in a text file named input file name.K. VABS dehomogenization analysis could output 3D displacement/strain/stress, or failure index/strength ratio distributions over the cross-section in different files as explained later. All these output files are in pure text format and can be opened by any text editor.
